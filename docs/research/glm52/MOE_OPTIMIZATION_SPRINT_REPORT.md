# PulsarMLX MoE Optimization Sprint Report

## Status

The bounded M1 Ultra MoE study begins at `cb1a0e06` on the isolated branch
`codex/glm52-moe-optimization`. It does not modify the independent Feature 017
checkout, run golden-eight, or implement direct quantized Metal.

## Phase 1: post-trunk P1 attribution

The exact P1 schema provides per-layer cache deltas after all eight routed
experts and the shared expert complete. It therefore supports exact layer-level
expert-cache attribution and route identities, but not individual-expert or
projection-level timing.

For the 316.758671-second warm terminal stack, all three shared matrices per
MoE layer were decoded-cache hits. Consequently, every recorded warm storage,
decode, contiguous-buffer, and matrix-build second belongs to the 24 transient
routed matrices per layer. Recorded MLX matvec time combines 24 routed and three
shared matvecs and cannot be split from the existing evidence.

The deterministic attribution record and generated review table are:

- [`raw/post-f016-p1-moe-attribution-0001.json`](raw/post-f016-p1-moe-attribution-0001.json)
- [`tables/post-f016-p1-moe-attribution-0001.md`](tables/post-f016-p1-moe-attribution-0001.md)

The table's top 20 entries are layer top-8 routed-expert sets ranked by complete
expert-cache attributed time. They are not individual-expert hotspots. P1 does
not time MLA versus MoE, gate/up/down, routed versus shared matvec, SwiGLU,
router, aggregation, or cleanup separately. Those are explicit timers for the
next bounded harness; no residual is relabeled as one of those stages.

Reproduce without checkpoint access:

```sh
python3 scripts/research/analyze_glm52_moe_p1.py
python3 scripts/research/analyze_glm52_moe_p1.py --check
python3 -m unittest scripts/research/tests/test_glm52_moe_p1_attribution.py
```
